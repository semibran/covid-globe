## Inspiration
COVID-19 is something that has affected all of us, each in varying amounts. Even with a vaccine being developed the threat of COVID-19 still looms large over many countries. A large contributor to the spread of the disease is underestimation of risk. We created an interactive 3D visualization of the spread of COVID-19 across the world to provide a strong visual source of how serious the impact of COVID-19 is.

## What it does
Displays the geographical history of COVID-19 on an interactive globe from your web browser. Automatically shows the hotspots in COVID-19 activity around the world over time. Also provides data about the number of vaccinations handed out per country.

## How we built it
React, Three.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku

## Challenges we ran into
Retrieving, storing, and displaying the data
Finding reliable sources of COVID-19-related information

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
Prioritization
3D rendering and interactivity
Database normalization and queries

## What's next for COVID-19 Worldwide
Retrieving new data automatically
Other categories for data visualization
UI improvements
